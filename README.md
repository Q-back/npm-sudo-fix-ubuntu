# npm-sudo-fix-ubuntu
naive script to fix npm needing sudo on Ubuntu. It's heavily inspired by [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16151018/npm-throws-error-without-sudo) and it just runs some commands mentioned there. **Use on your own risk**. I've saved this to use it and improve it whenever I'll get annoyed by Ubuntu + npm

## Easy run
If you're using Ubuntu just run:
```
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Q-back/npm-sudo-fix-ubuntu/master/npm-sudo-fix.sh | bash
```
**do not run this command with sudo** because it won't fix anything in this case.
# Do it on your own risk
I didn't care when I was creating the script, I've used in only on my virtual machine for one project.
