# npm-sudo-fix-ubuntu
naive script to fix npm needing sudo on Ubuntu. It's heavily inspired by [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16151018/npm-throws-error-without-sudo) and it just runs some commands mentioned there. Use on own risk. I've saved this to use it and improve it whenever I'll get annoyed by Ubuntu + npm
